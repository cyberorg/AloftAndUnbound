		    <div class="section-intro single-col-max mx-auto text-left mb-5"><p>How do you convey to someone, what is this “Paragliding Life”? This book will take you on a paragliding flight. It will give you a glimpse into what makes paragliding pilots want to go to the mountains any time they are allowed to. Sometimes risking their family’s displeasure, limbs and at times life. How does one's perceptions and priorities change after taking up this sport? This book will go about whetting your interest and curiosity in a roundabout, often confusing, and subtle way. Some of it may also be applicable to any pursuit that is passionately indulged in.</p><p>

There is a beautiful word “flow” which is used to describe a state of mind when you are completely absorbed in any activity. The actual act of flying can be described as “flow”. But flying, although major, is just one part of "Paragliding Life” - people, places, and the different experiences we are exposed to, add essential flavour to the whole package. In this book that is what is talked about; in a bunch of short essays.</p><p>

This book holds undeniable appeal for paragliding pilots, their friends, and family members. However, it goes beyond that—it is also a source of inspiration and wisdom for anyone on a genuine quest to learn from the virtues of journeying, valuing the process rather than being solely focused on the destination. For those who prefer visual storytelling, this book is thoughtfully embellished with a wealth of personally created pictures and drawings that will not only occupy your time but also stir your imagination.<p> </div>

              The book is made available through Print on Demand. From the publisher's website: "The books get listed on some of the most popular ecommerce websites like Flipkart, Amazon, and our very own Notion Press store. When readers find a book intriguing and decide to make a purchase, a purchase order is received by the ecommerce websites. The purchase order is then notified to people associated with the printing of the book, which provides details on the name of the book and the number of copies required. Depending on this information, the selected book goes for print and is delivered at readers doorsteps. So, every book that a reader owns is a fresh-print copy that has not been stocked in a warehouse."

            <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              That is due to two reasons. Firstly because of Print On Demand distribution. This book is extremely niche, so traditional publishing does not work. Traditional publishing requires a large print run passing on the economy of scale to the readers. In print on demand, each book is printed and shipped when someone orders it making it expensive.</p><p>Secondly, this book is printed in full colours on high quality art paper. Normal books are single colour and on 70 gsm normal paper.
            </p><p>Compared to other paragliding books, this book is still at a bargain price. It is about the same price as a bus ride between Delhi and Bir, which is not much.</p>

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              Depending on the queue the printers have, your order gets printed and then shipped, so it takes longer than normal order where the books are printed and kept in stock.

              No, because this book has a lot of full colour pages which will not render well on most ebook readers. Also the layout design of the book does not work well in instruments displaying single page at a time.

              Of course, this is the advantage of Print On Demand, your logo can be included in the book and on this page any time. Get in touch, it is not expensive to be in this #1 Best Seller.

Highly recommended."<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"><br><br>Aloft and Unbound tells a story of paragliding from a completely
different perspective. Jigish Gohil is an Indian paraglider pilot who now lives in Bir. The book opens with his first solo flight without any supervision, and a quick flashback to his training. 
<br><br>
He then takes us on a journey through the experiences he
has had mastering the art of paragliding, how it affects his
choice of where to live, and some of the applications of Buddhist
philosophy to flying. The sharp contrasts of learning and flying
outside the Western European bubble we’ve come to know are
some of the book’s most endearing points, and in this respect
it’s very different from most of the paragliding books on the
virtual shelves of the online book stores. There is no degree of
isolationism though; he also talks about – and gives credit
to – the external influences on Indian paragliding from
other countries.
<br><br>
The book is nicely organised into bite-sized chapters so you can
pick it up and put it down, but Jigish wants you to keep reading,
and tempts you with a segue at the very end of each chapter into
the next. He doesn’t take himself too seriously and makes jokes
about his standing in the community, and how much he’ll make
from writing the book (!). 
<br><br>
Whilst a fair proportion of the book revolves around Bir, Jigish
has travelled around India and writes about other sites and his
experiences there. He is a multi-faceted individual and enjoys a
number of other hobbies including photography and art, and is
the the curator of the Linux distro Li-f-e (Linux for Education).
This diversity allows him to weave other threads through the
book which add to the reading experience.
<br><br>
This is a well-written book, and one that dares to be different.
Highly recommended. [Steve Uzochukwu, Skywings, November 2023 issue.]

					        <p>"I wholeheartedly recommend "Aloft And Unbound" to anyone interested in exploring the wonders of paragliding or simply seeking an enjoyable read. Jigish's passion and authentic voice shine through these pages, and I am confident that you will find inspiration and delight within its covers.
."<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"><br><br>I feel honoured and touched when Jigish asked me to do the foreword for his book about the subject that is close to my heart. As someone whose life has been shaped by paragliding since the age of 14, I am a strong believer in the paragliding way of life and am passionate about sharing my love of the sport with others. 
<br><br>
When I first read Jigish's book "Aloft And Unbound," I was immediately intrigued. I am always eager to see how authors describe the experience of paragliding, as it can be challenging to articulate what it is all about. I believe that Jigish has done a fantastic job of conveying what paragliding is and the various elements that accompany it, such as the people we encounter, the relationships we develop, the locations we visit, and the adventures we have.
<br><br>
I am delighted to witness a pilot who genuinely embodies a passion for the sport, eagerly sharing his knowledge and experiences with the next generation of pilots, which is a trait we both value and appreciate. Having known Jigish for a long time and having observed his journey as a pilot since he first came to Bir, I've witnessed the positive changes that flying has brought to his life. Like many of us, he transitioned from being a visitor to Bir to becoming an integral part of the community. If you ever visit Bir, Jigish would be happy to welcome you to his home at Aloft in Bir for a cup of tea and a friendly chat. 
<br><br>
For pilots, in this book, you will be able to relate to a lot of the experiences, relationships, friendships, adventures, and stories told. There is also a lot of practical (and non-practical) info on the different flying sites around India with a little bit about the history and development of these sites, especially Bir, which, for many of us, holds a very special place in our hearts. Like Jigish, many pilots have made it their home. We also get a little bit of background and history of the Indian paragliding community.
<br><br>
For non-pilots, including family members or friends of paragliding pilots, this book offers a glimpse into why we are so enthusiastic about this sport and what it means to us. Whether it succeeds in conveying this message or not is up to the reader to determine after reading the book. The author blends adventure, experiences, personal stories, and insights, taking readers on a brief flight through our paragliding life with a pinch of quirky humour that I enjoyed immensely.
<br><br>
Whether you are a pilot or not, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about paragliding life or who simply enjoys a good read.<br>

<br><br>Where would we be, but for those who guide us?<br><br>

I’m Vishal, a long-time musician, yet a relative newbie to the world of paragliding, and someone deeply grateful for the  community-spirit in a sport that has led me to friends and guides, one of whom is Jigish.<br><br>

Jigish is a fixture in Bir, someone who shares his experience and knowledge with an open heart. (His YouTube guide to doing a 100km flight in Bir is genuinely helpful and is free to all!) His book is descriptive, engaging, funny, but I also see it as a unique social-guide to most paraglider pilots.<br><br>

You see, I’ve realised since I “joined the cult” that paragliding is the “veganism” of sport in that anyone who does it, preaches it! A lot! You can’t get us to shut up about it!<br><br> 

Sure, this comes from a place of love and enthusiasm, but the assumptions of a pilot in a conversation are that everyone dreams of flying and that everyone speaks “wind” in the same sort of arcane language that we use. The latter, of course, is emphatically not so!<br><br> 

That’s where this book is different. It’s light and quick, yet solid, like the best wings are. It’s accessible and understandable like the advice Jigish gives to new pilots who turn to him. Like a good pilot, it both looks back and moves forward, and brings the sky within reach. It shares experiences, and it addresses both the updrafts and downdrafts of the sport we love, and the sites we love to fly in.<br><br>

Jigish shares not just his love for paragliding and places we fly, but also his love for the people of and around the sport. This book is a record of the people and places he knew and the one he knows today and hopefully, it may bring you to these places that you may experience from the sky someday.<br>
